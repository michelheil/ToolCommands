# Turn on Bluetooth

https://askubuntu.com/questions/1231074/ubuntu-20-04-bluetooth-not-working

I experienced the same issue, after a hot boot switch from Windows to Ubuntu, Bluetooth failed to work. I followed the Ubuntu bug report here, and Bluetooth fully functions. Use the following commands:

    sudo rmmod btusb
    sudo modprobe btusb
